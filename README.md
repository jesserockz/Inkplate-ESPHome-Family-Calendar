# Prerequisites
- Home Assistant running
     - NodeRed w/Node-Red add-on (integration) in HA for API connectivity
     - ESPHome
- Inkplate6 (will support 10 when i get mine) w/[1200MaH](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BTSPZW8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or higher Battery
- Patience and forgiveness for my shitty code

# Installation
- NodeRed
     - Import the NodeRed setup to a new pane and customize the google api variables and your calendar data. To do this you'll need to learn how those nodes work, which is a huge pain in the ass in itself and I wish you the best of luck.
- ESPHome
     - Add the folder structure in this repo within your /config/esphome dir on your HA install. You'll want to find fonts or customize the YAML to address the missing ones.
- Inkplate
     - I like using the CLI binary. Find the ESPHome-Flasher.app and put it in your applications folder. chmod as needed and then use it this way: `./ESPHome-Flasher.app/Contents/MacOS/ESPHome-Flasher -p /dev/tty.usbserial-310 /Users/you/dev/thisreponame/inkplate.bin`. To find your serial port, `ls -al /dev/tty*`.

# Notes / To-do
1. I don't have deep sleep working yet. Therefore I just turn it off after it syncs each morning.
2. It will crash if your data isn't available in the API via NodeRed. If this happens just manually push the data via the inject node and give it a few more times to boot.
3. It crashes a lot
4. I have location strings disabled right now until I fix something and will push a fix for that soon.
5. ESPHome-Inkplate is calculating the voltage incorrectly. I've asked [@jesserockz](https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-Arduino-library/commit/27c9b71f51b70f3b0df6750bcc0f46a550b408de) to look into this.


# Support
None. This is mainly for me right now and not for you. If you're interested in trying it out and wish to collaborate, please contact me at @303 on twitter.
 
# Thanks
- [@jesserockz] for providing the ESPHome-Inkplate library
- [@jeffehobbs] for setting me on this path and providing guidance
